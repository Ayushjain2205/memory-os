# 🧠 About MemoryOS

## 📌 Overview

**MemoryOS** is the programmable memory layer for AI — built for continuity, context, and control. It solves one of the biggest limitations of large language models (LLMs): their inability to retain memory across interactions.

With MemoryOS, users can store structured memory — preferences, goals, facts, observations — and reuse them across different AI tools and agents. Our mission is to make memory portable, permissioned, and user-owned.

We're also building **Sign in with MemoryOS**, a universal identity and memory interface that allows users to bring their memory into any AI application — enabling interoperability across the LLM ecosystem.

“The programmable memory layer for your AI to think in context.”

## ❗ Problem

- 🔁 You repeat yourself every time you switch LLMs
- 🔒 Your memory isn’t truly owned or controlled by you
- 🧩 Context is trapped in silos across apps
- 🚫 No continuity, no personalization across tools

In the age of context engineering, memory is no longer optional. It’s essential.

---

## 💡 Solution

- 🧠 One memory layer for all your tools
- 💾 Store preferences, facts, and goals once
- 🔗 Let AI apps access what’s relevant, when needed
- 🔐 Fully permissioned and under your control

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### ✅ Memory Vault

- Store memory types like:

  - 🎯 Goals
  - 🎨 Preferences
  - 📚 Facts
  - 👁️ Observations
  - 🛠️ Instructions

- Attach priority levels (Low / Medium / High)
- Organize by profile (e.g. Work, Personal, Health)

### 🧭 Web App

- Manually add/edit memory entries
- Manage instructions and files
- Switch between profiles
- See which apps accessed memory and when

### 🧩 Chrome Extension

- Ingest context from browsing and online activity
- Inject memory into ChatGPT and other LLMs
- Overlay UI for prompt enhancement

### 🔌 Integrations

- Use MemoryOS with:

  - ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini (via prompt injection)
  - Notion, Telegram, Chrome (via extension)
  - Any agent via API or MCP

### 🔄 MCP Compatibility

- 🔄 **MCP-native**: MemoryOS can both supply and sync memory across any agent stack
- Connect a third-party agent as a **memory source**, or serve your memory vault as a **memory sink** for other tools

### 🔐 Memory Ownership

- Your memory is **truly owned, managed, and controlled by you**
- Each item has visibility scope and access permissions
- Supports decentralized storage (e.g., Filecoin, Lit Protocol)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Ingest**: via browser extension or web app
2. **Store**: structured memory with type and priority
3. **Manage**: organize, edit, delete, or tag memories
4. **Inject**: context auto-applied into AI tools
5. **Sync**: bidirectional MCP support

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Chat with context-aware assistants that remember you
- Build agents that act based on long-term goals and preferences
- Inject relevant memory into writing tools, productivity apps, and health logs
- Share memory with your own LLM stack

---

## 📈 Why Now

- 📈 AI agents and LLMs are everywhere — and growing fast
- 🙋‍♀️ Users want smarter, more personalized assistants
- 🧠 Memory is key to effective context engineering
- 🕸️ A shared memory standard unlocks ecosystem scale

---

## 📅 Roadmap

### ✅ Now

- Memory vault web app
- Chrome extension (inject + ingest)
- Manual and API-based memory input

### 🧠 Coming Next

- Encrypted Filecoin vaults
- Agent SDKs
- Multi-agent sync and team profiles
- Pay-to-store APIs
